    quest:
      "Can an individual install it themselves after purchasing it?",
    ans: `It's impossible. Installation of ZAVA is not finished with just about installation. After that, fine-tuning step is essential. An experienced expert is necessary for it.`,

    quest:
      "What is the approximate construction and fine-tuning schedule?",
    ans: `"We conduct a preliminary visit and consultation to obtain information about the building and space: 1 to 2 hours.
    (If you can send specific and detailed information*, it can be omitted.)
    Construction and fine-tuning are carried out using information obtained through prior visits and consultations: 1 to 2 days.
    
    *Contents of Specific and Detailed Information:
    - Type of building (wooden, steel, reinforced concrete, masonry, etc.),
    - Photos taken from various angles of the spot where the camera was installed,
    - Finishing materials and method of the spot where the camera was installed,
    - Recorded video footage of the screen trembling with zoomed to the maximum,

    quest: "Will any re-fine-tuning be required after installation?",
    ans: `No. Once installed and tuned, ZAVA functions semi-permanently.
    
    However, there are exceptions in the following situations.
    i. If you arbitrarily change the adjustment and tuning of ZAVA
    ii. If you arbitrarily change the installation spot of ZAVA
    iii. When replacing a mounted camera
    iii. When changing the environment around the spot where ZAVA is installed
    
    If you request us to travel and tune in again for these reasons, you will be charged travel and tuning costs even if it is within the warranty period.`,
